I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use.

You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the \"\"my contributions\"\" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting \"\"Image\"\" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.\n\nAs well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.\n\nIf you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link]. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If the image is copyrighted under a non-free license (per Wikipedia:Fair use) then the image will be deleted 48 hours after .

I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly \"\"enhanced;\"\" and I also believe those changes are no improvement.  \n\nIn support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists.\n A1. Benjamin Cardozo\n A2. Learned Hand\n\n B1. John Marshall Harlan\n B2. John Marshall Harlan II\n\nThe question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.\n\nPerhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. \n\nLess humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.\n\nAt a minimum, I'm questioning this edit?

If you know you are telling the truth, you will argue with machine or investigator.

As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a \"\"Third Way\"\" as the references show.\n\nThe only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to \"\"cover up\"\" its socialistic origins and third way status.

BITCH !!!!!!!!!It also stands for the name Brittany Fellows—Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    \n\n ==etymology== \n The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning \"\"female of the dog\"\" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that \"\"the converse is equally possible.\"\" \n The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  \n The verb meaning to complain in 1930. \n Slang Bitchen \"\"good\"\" is attested to the 1950's \n\n == reclaiming the word bitch == \n The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is \"\"pig\"\", \"\"dog\"\", \"\"cow\"\" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to \"\"reclaim\"\" as bitch simply means a female canine. \n\n It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. \n\n    \n It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women \"\"reclaiming\"\" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word \"\"bitch\"\" any more than it reclaims the word \"\"sinner.\"\" \n\n Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? \n\n \n\n :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, \"\"She's a Bitch\"\".   \n\n ::References are fine  just the name \"\"Missy Elliot\"\" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned \"\"reclaiming\"\" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   \n\n :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting \"\"querolous\"\", \"\"spiteful\"\", and \"\"malicious\"\" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   \n\n ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   \n\n :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like \"\"bitch\"\" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of \"\"bitch\"\" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it. \n\n :::::However, I still don't see the point of reclamati"

         "\"This is completely absurd.  Maybe this is the case in the United States, however your northern neighbour makes no such claims.  The Philosophy of Chiropractic far exceeds a modality (manual/mechanical manipulation) and a lesion (vertebral subluxation/joint dyskinesis). It is about a holistic approach to health care using natural therapies primarily (joint manipulation, soft tissue manipulation exercise, nutritional counseling, medical acupuncturestress management, health promotion, ergonomic consulting, etc.  To insinuate that the existence of the profession depends on subluxations is a dated, narrowed view of Contemporary Chiropractic.\n\nAlso, anyone who knows a lick of neurology realizes that there neurophysiological effects of manipulation and, similarly, there are neurophysiological effects of joint dyskinesis/subluxation.   However, these are being taken in a neuromusculoskeletal context now as well as possible autonomic implications on visceral functions that may arise from chronic NMS pain syndromes.  This is a contemporary view of the profession.\n\nThe title DC or chiropractor certainly does not imply manipulation for subluxation.  Again, a narrowed view focus.  Rather we are holistic NMS doctors with an emphasis on manual therapies and other complementary therapies.  We;re not wannabe MDs or \"\"glorified PTs\"\".  DCs trained in scientific schools are perfectly positioned to play a crucial role in managing and preventing NMS issues and PCP role.  \nI would encourage you, Fyslee, to visit the CCA website or the new OCA one and you tell me that my sole purpose is to rid subluxations.  It is, at least in Canada, a dying faction as CMCC and UQTR embrance scientific chiropractic and not traditional/philosophical (straight) chiropractic.\n\nwww.chiropractic.on.ca\n\nIt is always important to have different perspectives on issues to remain objective.  I am not an evangelist (as a good analogy to the straights/subluxation based) and definitely have my criticisms with my profession, but it's mainly a generational thing.  The evidence-based Doctor of Chiropractic in 2008 is not tied down to the philosophy of subluxations (metaphysically) or at least in Canada (my POV which conflicts with your chiropractic POV which is US and not a world wide one.  \n\nIn fact, every DC since 2002 has been educated in the integrative EBM curriculum (CMCC is 45 minutes away from McMaster University, where evidence based medicine was born) Canada, unlike the US has NO subluxation based schools and they are both university degree granting institutions.  This is important because credits obtained at CMCC and UQTR can be TRANSFERRED to public universities unlike before.\n\nIn the end, Fyslee, you will begin to appreciate the sophistication of contemporary chiropractors.  Most of us have 4 year undergrad degrees in kinesiology of the life sciences and obtain various other treatment modalities (soft tissue such as ART/Graston/SASTM, get diplomas in Medical Acupuncture from McMaster University by the Department of Anaesthesia from MDs who designed the course from a anatomy/neurophysiological POV, obtained CSCS designations from the NSCA (http://www.nsca-cc.org/) etc.\n\nI am anxious to hear your response.\n\n\"",
